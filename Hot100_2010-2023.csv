I'm redeeming you – no you ain't I'm bad, and someone like that can't become a saint It's too ingrained – He said, there's no one good – you're goin' straight I took command, and I'm winnin' you back – your soul is saved But, Lord, my past was awful, I feel so estranged I'm trapped – Who trapped you? I don't see no ball and chain I laid hands on you – you'll never do this alone again I guess you don't know the Lord's grace  Don't understand why they brought You myrrh But that's all right because I like Your day of birth Don't understand why You'd heal, me, Christ But that's all right because I lived the day You died I lived the day You died I lived the day You died  You know, they struck His body so much He could breathe when they hit Him But Jesus, He did not refuse, even though they whipped Him Not a warm, fuzzy feeling, gettin' killed just for livin' Like He's some punk they didn't know from Adam The Lord, He said, forgive 'em When they did those things to hurt Him Though they spit upon His face and invented stuff to curse and convict Him They plucked out his facial hair Laughed while givin' Him a thorny crown Pinned Him to a cross in the Roman mannerism Yet they gave Him a cold drink to cope with though Something infinitesimal, a gesture made Guess that they didn't know that in their painkilling recipe Something was left over from a different day One that came with frankincense and gold It was embalmer's myrrh Mixed with wine – He still refrained You don't get it, Wonder Man, Christ was not immune to pain But it's not in vain Now the rest of us receive God's forgiveness Guess that's why they say ""no pain no gain"" ",

If you don’t give it all you got, you’re only cheating yourself give it all you got but if it ends up happening, it ends up happening  That’s what happening with me, it’s like “God, I’m giving it all I’ve got, sometimes I’m weak and I’m going to do it.” And it’s like I’m not giving myself grace, I’m just like understanding that’s how it is ",
